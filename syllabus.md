#### Lab Details

BI 101 is laboratory-based course, so your participation in laboratory is essential. If your grade is an F in lab, your grade for the course will be an F as well. A student must have at least a D in lab to earn a C (or higher) in the course. **Students who miss more than two weeks of lab will receive an F in the course.**

This lab component is worth 30% of your grade for the lecture+lab course. That 30% comprises participation and attendance, post-lab assignments, and weekly quizzes.

There are 10 lab exercises. This is the hands-on, self-directed portion of the class. You must come to lab prepared (i.e., **you must read the lab exercise before you come to class**). You are expected to perform the lab exercises with your group.


### Attendance Policy

If you are unable to attend a class, I will not have notes available for you; please get in touch with a classmate (or better yet, ask one in advance to take notes for you if you know in advance that you won't be there).

#### Lab Attendance
Lab attendance is required. You will receive an F for lab if you miss more than 2 labs.

Post labs: Post labs are due very first thing in lab. If you are more than ten minutes late to lab, this will result in an automatic 10% deduction of the post lab due that week.

No make-up labs will be provided.  However, if students miss a lab, they may make up the lab by attending another available section in the same week. As a courtesy, the student should ask the other instructor for permission in advance to attend their lab. The student will take the quiz given by the substitute instructor. The substitute instructor should grade the quiz and put it in the box of the regular instructor along with the post-lab assignment.

Students that leave lab before having completed the lab will be considered absent from that lab and lose all points from the lab.

If a student is absent and does not attend another lab, they can turn in their post-lab (from before their absence) without a late penalty, but they must take the scheduled quiz (not the one they missed during their absence).

Students will be asked to show the instructor their work (in lab manual) before they leave lab to confirm completion of the lab.

### Lab information

#### Post Labs
Post Labs are in your lab manual. They will be due at the beginning of lab the week after the lab is complete (unless told otherwise). They are worth 10 points each.
	If you turn your post-labs in late on the due date, they may be marked down up to 10% at my discretion even if you are just tardy or forget to turn it in. Post-labs will be marked down an additional 10% each day. You may submit the post lab electronically (even photos with your phone will do) if this helps you turn it in earlier. They will not be accepted after one week beyond the due date.
	You cannot receive credit for a postlab assignment if you did not complete the lab. If you miss a lab, you may turn your previous postlab in when you return with no late penalty.
	Although you may work together as a group, you may not copy from your lab mates. If I suspect you are copying from another student (or allowing another student to copy your work), you will receive a zero for the assignment and I will report you to the college for disciplinary action.
If you are absent and unable to attend another lab, you can turn in your post-lab (from before your absence) without a late penalty. However, you must take the scheduled quiz (not the one that you missed during your absence).

#### Lab Quizzes

Quizzes will primarily cover specific material from the previous lab. They may also cover some general material from the current week’s lab. They are worth 10 points each. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

You will have the first 10-15 minutes of lab to complete the quiz. If you are late, you will only have the time remaining to complete it. There are no make-up quizzes - no exceptions.

#### Participation

 In addition to the graded materials, you will also be graded on preparedness, participation, courtesy, respect, and cooperation with your group. I reserve the right to deduct points from post labs and quizzes for issues related to participation.

#### Expectations

Science doesn't come naturally to most people. If this is your first collegiate science course, you might be surprised at the amount of time required to be successful. Typically for every 1 hour a student is in a classroom lecture, they should be putting in 3 hours of homework on assignments, reading, and study time. This can vary for each student depending on how effectively you use your time and how well you comprehend the reading, but it should give you an idea of a typical college course expectation.

Your effort outside of class will be reflected in the quality of work you do and result in a corresponding grade. In other words, do not expect an “A” grade when you are not putting in the time/effort outside of the classroom to achieve “A” work.


##### Specific student responsibilities

1.	You are responsible for knowing the due dates of assignments.

2. If you miss class, you are responsible for obtaining materials/announcements from other students. Handouts will not be brought to class a second time for those students who missed class.
3.	You are responsible for knowing how you are doing in class. All points are cumulative. Instructors make grading mistakes, so it will benefit you to keep your own backup records.

*As you might imagine, we instructors get a ton of emails containing questions that could easily be answered by looking at this document, the course schedule, or referring to announcements made online. As a courtesy to me, please make sure that these information sources have been checked before you email me with logistical questions. I reserve the right to reply with, "see syllabus" or "see announcements".*

### Course Policies

#### Class Preparation

Success in this course depends not only on attendance, but also on effort. Many of the concepts that we will discuss tend to be unfamiliar to students, and much of the vocabulary will likely also be new. In order to make the most of class time, read over the assigned chapters or sections BEFORE the class and then re-read them more carefully DIRECTLY AFTER the class in which they are discussed. Waiting until right before a test to read the text is highly ineffective. Throughout the quarter, there will be in-class group activities and I will also be calling on students for responses to questions. Your participation on these fronts will contribute to your final grade (via the homework component).

#### Study Suggestions

In my experience, most introductory-level science classes are challenging because they introduce new terminology and concepts. It will be important to use study time wisely. Here is a list of suggestions:

- Work hard during lectures. This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed. Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.

- Make a list of questions as you study your notes and read the textbook. Ask these questions during conference, lecture, or ask another student while you're studying.

- Use the homework questions in Mastering Biology as a study guide. These review questions will highlight what is most important to focus on in the text. If any of my objectives for a unit go beyond those mentioned in the textbook, I will make you aware of that.

- Form study groups! Study groups can help everyone, whether you are doing well or are doing poorly. Use your study group to quiz each other and offer short teaching demos to each other on particular topics; you never truly appreciate what you know and don't know until you have to teach it to somebody else.

#### Classroom Behavior

Modern technology is amazing, and in many instances it can be a tremendous learning asset. I'm not going to stop you from having or using these resources in class, and indeed will often leverage them to enhance your learning experience. However, sometimes the myriad temptations provided by having a phone, tablet, or laptop in front of you can compete with the course content for your attention.

There are several studies that demonstrate a dramatic decrease of retention when a learner tries to multi-task, so please be aware of this and be warned that YOU ARE NOT MIRACULOUSLY IMMUNE TO THIS EFFECT.

If you are honest with yourself and find the temptation too great, I strongly recommend taking notes by hand.

A respectful environment will be maintained at all times. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct online so you understand the student rights and responsibilities.

#### Late Assignment Policy

All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date unless otherwise noted. Any materials that are received after class on the due date will be marked down 10%. Late assignments will be marked down 10% each day after the due date. Late assignments will not be accepted after one week past their due date. No late online assignments will be accepted. If you have computer problems, you must contact me before the due date. No materials will be accepted after the last day of class, and no materials will be accepted during finals week.

#### Missed Exams

Make up exams must be arranged with the instructor prior to the day of the scheduled exam and are at the discretion of the instructor.

You must take the final exam as scheduled. No make up finals are permitted.
